# DS25-ExplodingKittens
A distributed base implementation of the popular card game Exploding Kittens.
Exploding Kittens is a card game for 2–5 players. On each turn, a player either plays action cards from their hand or draws from the deck. 
Draw an Exploding Kitten and you're out — unless you have a Defuse card to save yourself.
The last player standing wins.

- 💣 Exploding Kitten -->You explode Unless you have a Defuse.
- 🛡️ Defuse --> Neutralizes an Exploding Kitten and puts it back in the deck.
- ⏭️ Skip --> End your turn without drawing.
- ⚔️ Attack --> End your turn and force the next player to take two turns.
- 🔀 Shuffle --> Shuffle the draw pile.
- 👁️ See the Future --> Peek at the top 3 cards of the deck.
- 🚫 Nope --> Cancel the action of any card played by another player.
