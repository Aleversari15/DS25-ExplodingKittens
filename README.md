# DS25-ExplodingKittens
A distributed base implementation of the popular card game Exploding Kittens.
Exploding Kittens is a card game for 2–5 players. On each turn, a player either plays action cards from their hand or draws from the deck. 
Draw an Exploding Kitten and you're out — unless you have a Defuse card to save yourself.
The last player standing wins.
